It quantifies the dissimilarity between the predicted probability distribution and the true one-hot encoded labels. The model aims to minimize this loss during training.\n",

It adapts the learning rate (how much the parameters are updated) based on the historical gradients. This allows the optimizer to automatically adjust the learning rate for each parameter individually, which can improve convergence and learning speed.\n",
    "- `metrics=['accuracy']`: Metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the model. Accuracy is a commonly used metric for classification tasks. It measures the percentage of correctly predicted samples out of the total number of samples. For example, if the model predicts the correct class for 80 out of 100 samples, the accuracy would be 80%."
